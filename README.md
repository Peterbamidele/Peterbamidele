### Hi, Are you there 👋

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on  creating content for my blog and create videos for YouTube  that will help people learn and grow in the tech community
- 🤔 I need assistance in software design patterns, system design, artificial intelligence, and embedded systems.
- 💬 Ask me about Java, Python, Cypress, Database and PHP.
